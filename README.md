3. Click **Map Last Note**

### Priority Levels

- **0 (Normal)**: Standard notification
- **-1 (Low)**: No sound/vibration
- **-2 (Lowest)**: No notification, just badge

### Default Mappings

The app comes with three default mappings:
- **Note 60 (Middle C)**: "Stage needs assistance!" (High priority)
- **Note 62 (D)**: "Technical issue on stage" (Normal priority)
- **Note 64 (E)**: "Sound check requested" (Low priority)
